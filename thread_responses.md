Herein lay responses to some key comments in the RFC that we cannot respond to directly, on account of our ban.

Reading "evidence" mirror document, I can state that, quoting from you:

It may be the case that not all participants in the current community around NixOS/Nix are reasonable actors desiring a community of diverse yet equal participants, but rather prefer to exclude people on unreasonable grounds to satisfy a purely subjective desire or feeling.

Is exactly what you are doing. Using the term "myth of marginalization", it is absolutely tone deaf.

This is not a document intended to resolve conflict. This is a molotov cocktail intended to light-up the community.

You know what you are doing.

No.
```

I don't know why you quote "evidence", as if that's not what it was. The document is fairly objective, and you can verify its contents for yourself. It also contains due respect and doesn't throw out any baseless accusations such as this one. Every claim is justified with a reasoning.

I don't really care about "tone" necessarily, although I can't say it's been a very pleasant one either. The thing we are driving at here, and attempting to uncover, is the truth, however imperfectly. In actual fact, people have been using their completely unverifiable marginalized status as a badge to behave poorly and get away with it, as the evidence document demonstrates. It also encourages rabid paranoia and an endless witch hunt (see me being banned for pointing it out) which allows for a nice distraction while power is consolidated, which we have seen here and elsewhere many times by now. Can we not pretend we haven't? Thanks.

That is some pretty nice blame shifting, but in all actuality, the community was already on fire. You know that, you threw some of those molotovs yourself samuel, and now you are trying to put my fingerprints on them to absolve yourself.
