Herein lay responses to some key comments in the RFC that we cannot respond to directly, on account of our ban.

Reading "evidence" mirror document, I can state that, quoting from you:

It may be the case that not all participants in the current community around NixOS/Nix are reasonable actors desiring a community of diverse yet equal participants, but rather prefer to exclude people on unreasonable grounds to satisfy a purely subjective desire or feeling.

Is exactly what you are doing. Using the term "myth of marginalization", it is absolutely tone deaf.

This is not a document intended to resolve conflict. This is a molotov cocktail intended to light-up the community.

You know what you are doing.

No.
```

I don't know why you quote "evidence", as if that's not what it was. The document is fairly objective, and you can verify its contents for yourself. It also contains due respect and doesn't throw out any baseless accusations such as this one. Every claim is justified with a reasoning.

I don't really care about "tone" necessarily, although I can't say it's been a very pleasant one either. The thing we are driving at here, and attempting to uncover, is the truth, however imperfectly. In actual fact, people have been using their completely unverifiable marginalized status as a badge to behave poorly and get away with it, as the evidence document demonstrates. It also encourages rabid paranoia and an endless witch hunt (see me being banned for pointing it out) which allows for a nice distraction while power is consolidated, which we have seen here and elsewhere many times by now. Can we not pretend we haven't? Thanks.

> This is not a document intended to resolve conflict. This is a molotov cocktail intended to light-up the community.

That is some pretty nice blame shifting, but in all actuality, the community was already on fire. You know that, you threw some of those molotovs yourself samuel, and now you are trying to put my fingerprints on them to absolve yourself.

This is tone policing document, seeking to embolden folks who are seemingly, if I as an outsider understand the context, using their technical contributions, to undermine the group consensus on how to behave.

If you're a great contractor, but you take a dump on the home-owners couch, they have the right to both ask you to stop, and throw you out! It doesn't matter how good your work is, how dilligent you are, how much you internally care, or why you think that behaviour is acceptable; folks told you it wasn't, presumably when you start threads questioning diversity and representation, and apparently you get a temporary ban. Which is understandable but very light-touch.

I am more than happy to speak on my own behalf, and I would ask please refrain from putting words in my mouth regarding intent, especially while I am purposefully muzzled. There is, however, a worrying trend again being demonstrated here, which also demonstrates quite nicely that your claim is false. Nobody is undermining group consensus on how to behave, because such a thing doesn't exist. If you forcibly silence all your detractors, that isn't consensus, that is something else entirely. I'll let you define it. Go ahead.

Also, as a matter of taste, your illustration is both unnecessarily explicit, and also inaccurate (i.e. inflammatory). Disagreeing with you is in no way a parallel of defecation. This is a good example of comments that should probably be moderated, but are not.
